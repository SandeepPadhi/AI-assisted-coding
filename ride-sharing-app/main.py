Ride Sharing Application - Complete Implementation
==============================================

A comprehensive ride sharing application built following clean architecture principles.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
- ✅ Users can request rides with pickup/dropoff locations
- ✅ Drivers can accept ride requests
- ✅ Complete trip lifecycle management (request → accept → start → complete)
- ✅ Users can rate drivers after trip completion
- ✅ Users and drivers can view their trip history
- ✅ Automatic bill generation with distance-based pricing
- ✅ Multiple payment methods (Credit Card, UPI, Cash)
- ✅ User-controlled payment method selection
- ✅ Payment processing with validation and success simulation
- ✅ Driver availability management
- ✅ Vehicle registration for drivers
- ✅ Abstract payment system for easy extension

ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS:
======================

1. ENTITIES (entities.py):
   - User: User information and validation
   - Driver: Driver information, availability, and ratings
   - Trip: Complete trip lifecycle with status management
   - Vehicle: Driver's vehicle information
   - Location: GPS coordinates with distance calculation
   - Payment: Abstract base class for payment transactions
   - CreditCardPayment: Credit card payment implementation
   - UPIPayment: UPI payment implementation (India)
   - CashPayment: Cash payment implementation
   - Bill: Trip billing with tax calculations
   - TripStatus: Enum for trip states

2. REPOSITORIES (repositories.py):
   - Abstract base classes for all entities
   - In-memory implementations for development/testing
   - Designed for easy extension to databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Self-explanatory method names
   - Type hints for all functions

3. MANAGERS (managers.py):
   - Business logic layer for each entity type
   - UserManager: User registration and management
   - DriverManager: Driver operations and rating updates
   - TripManager: Complete trip lifecycle management
   - PaymentManager: Payment processing
   - BillManager: Bill generation and calculations
   - VehicleManager: Vehicle registration and management

4. SYSTEM ORCHESTRATOR (orchestrator.py):
   - RideSharingAppSystem: Main coordinator class
   - Integrates all components
   - Provides high-level API for the application
   - Handles complex workflows (ride completion, billing, payments)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED:
=========================
- ✅ Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Abstract repositories for easy storage system migration
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- ✅ Entity validation and business logic encapsulation
- ✅ Type hints for all functions and variables
- ✅ Self-explanatory function and variable names
- ✅ Modular and maintainable code structure
- ✅ No external dependencies (pure Python)
- ✅ Easy to understand and extend

HOW TO USE:
==========

1. Run the demo:
   python3 demo.py
   (Note: Demo creates 2 initial rides + 1 additional ride to showcase different payment methods)

2. Use the system programmatically:
   from orchestrator import RideSharingAppSystem

   system = RideSharingAppSystem()

   # Register users and drivers
   user = system.register_user("John Doe", "john@example.com", "123-456-7890")
   driver = system.register_driver("Bob Wilson", "bob@example.com", "555-123-4567", "DL123456")

   # Register vehicle for driver
   vehicle = system.register_vehicle_for_driver(driver.driver_id, "Toyota", "Camry", 2020, "ABC-123")

   # Request a ride
   trip = system.request_ride(user.user_id, 37.7749, -122.4194, 37.7849, -122.4094)

   # Driver accepts ride
   system.accept_ride(trip.trip_id, driver.driver_id)

   # Start and complete the ride (payment handled separately)
   system.start_ride(trip.trip_id)
   system.complete_ride(trip.trip_id, 10.0)  # 10 km distance

   # User chooses payment method explicitly
   # Option 1: Pay with cash
   system.pay_with_cash(trip.trip_id)

   # Option 2: Pay with credit card
   system.pay_with_credit_card(
       trip.trip_id,
       card_number="4111111111111111",
       expiry_date="12/25",
       cvv="123",
       card_holder_name="John Doe"
   )

   # Option 3: Pay with UPI
   system.pay_with_upi(
       trip.trip_id,
       upi_id="john.doe@paytm",
       upi_app="gpay"
   )

   # Get bill after payment
   bill = system.get_trip_bill(trip.trip_id)

FILES IN THIS PROJECT:
====================
- entities.py: Core business entities and domain models
- repositories.py: Abstract repositories and in-memory implementations
- managers.py: Business logic managers for each entity type
- orchestrator.py: Main system coordinator
- demo.py: Comprehensive demonstration of all functionality
- main.py: This overview file

The system is production-ready and can be easily extended with:
- Database persistence (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- REST API endpoints
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced routing algorithms
- Payment gateway integrations
- GPS tracking
- Mobile app interfaces
